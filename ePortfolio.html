      <h2 id="about">About Me</h2>

      <p>Welcome to my Webpage, I am an ambitious international student from Belize, who has embarked on a transformative journey pursuing my passion for computer science at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_North_Florida" target="_blank" id="index">University of North Florida (UNF)</a>. Fueled by a desire to immerse myself in cutting-edge technology and innovation, I have chosen UNF for its renowned computer science program and its vibrant, diverse campus environment. My academic pursuits are complemented by my active involvement in student organizations, where I collaborate with peers from various cultural backgrounds, fostering a rich exchange of ideas and perspectives.</p>

      <p>Driven by a vision to contribute to the ever-evolving world of technology, I aspire to become a software engineer upon completing my studies. I am particularly drawn to the field's dynamic nature and the potential to create impactful solutions to real-world problems. My dedication to continuous learning and my cross-cultural experiences at UNF contribute to my well-rounded approach, preparing me for a successful career in the global software engineering landscape.</p>

      <h2 id="hobb">Hobbies & Interests</h2>

      <p>In my leisure time, I indulge in a variety of hobbies that allow me to stay active and connected with my interests. One of my greatest passions is soccer, where the thrill of the game and the camaraderie with teammates create an unparalleled sense of joy. I have a deep enjoyment for watching soccer as well with my favorite team being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF" target="_blank" id="index">Real Madrid CF</a>. Additionally, I immerse myself in the competitive spirit of flag football, relishing the strategic plays and teamwork that characterize the sport. Volleyball also holds a special place in my heart, providing an outlet for both physical activity and friendly competition.</p>

      <p>When I'm not on the field or the court, I find solace in the virtual realm through video games. Whether exploring fantastical worlds, engaging in strategic battles, or solving intricate puzzles, gaming serves as a dynamic and immersive escape. Beyond individual pursuits, I prioritize spending quality time with friends and family. These cherished moments, whether gathered around the dinner table, enjoying outdoor activities, or simply sharing laughter, strengthen the bonds that are central to my well-being. My hobbies not only reflect my diverse interests but also highlight my commitment to balance, ensuring that both physical and social dimensions are integral components of my leisure pursuits.</p>

      <h2 id="edu">Education</h2>

      <p>My educational journey has been marked by a commitment to excellence and a passion for computer science. I earned my high school degree at Toledo Community College (TCC), where I laid the foundation for my academic pursuits. This experience not only provided me with a solid educational base but also instilled in me a strong work ethic and a thirst for knowledge. Building upon this foundation, I pursued an associates degree in computer science at St. Johns College Junior College in Belize. This program not only expanded my understanding of key computer science principles but also allowed me to apply my skills in practical settings. The diverse curriculum and hands-on experiences at St. Johns College Junior College further fueled my determination to pursue higher education in the field.</p>

      <p>Currently, I am on the path to achieving a Bachelors degree in computer science at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_North_Florida" target="_blank" id="index">University of North Florida (UNF)</a>. The comprehensive and cutting-edge curriculum at UNF aligns seamlessly with my career aspirations in software engineering. As I delve into advanced coursework and engage in collaborative projects, I am continually honing my programming skills and gaining a deeper understanding of the latest technological advancements. The academic environment at UNF provides the perfect platform for me to integrate theoretical knowledge with real-world applications, preparing me to make meaningful contributions to the dynamic field of computer science upon graduation.</p>
